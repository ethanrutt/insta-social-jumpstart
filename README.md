Automated bot for sending recruiting messages using selenium in python


Hello, this is my first github repository that i've created by myself. It is just a simple script for sending messages on instagram.
It uses selenium to open up an instance of a chrome tab, login to an instagram, and copy paste a message to people. 

- The username and password fields in the class must be set to the desired login
- The message must be initialized to a string so that the bot knows what to send

I used this to send recruiting messages to leads that I collected while I was working as a branch manager for vector marketing in the summer 0f 2022
